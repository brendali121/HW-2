## Admistrative:

Please indicate

* Who you collaborated with:
* Roughly how much time you spent on this HW so far: 1.5 Hour
* The URL of the RPubs published URL [here](http://rpubs.com/brendali121/HW2).
* What gave you the most trouble: In terms of EDA, deciding how I wanted to interpret the data, and deciding whether to exclude certain data points.
* Any comments you have:



## Question 1:

Perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the `profiles` data set,
specifically on the relationship between gender and

* `income`
* `job`
* One more categorical variable of your choice

all keeping in mind in HW-3, you will be fitting a logistic regression to
predict a user's gender based on these variables.

Income by Gender: 

An examination of the missing income values shows us that 87% of women in the data set neglected to include their incomes while 77% of men did the same. Thus, our EDA of income by gender will be slightly skewed since a greater percentage of women chose not to report their incomes.
We can see from the first set of boxplots that the first quartile, median, and third quartile of income is lower for women than for men.  

However, for both genders, there are significant outliers in the dataset, Thus, I generated to separate boxplots, with one showing incomes less than $100k and one showing incomes greater than $100k.  What these two boxplot reveals is that while the median and interquartile range of incomes for women is less than men when we're looking at incomes less than $100k, that is not the case when looking at incomes greater than $100k.  In the later case, the median income for both genders is about the same, but the interquartile range for women is much greater than for men.

Job by Gender: 

An exploration of the missing job values reveals that about the same percentage of men and women declined to submit their job, which means an EDA without these entries with missing data may not be that skewed.

We can see from the first bar graph that for all fields except "clerical/administrative" and "eduacation/academia", the number of males in the field was higher than the number of females.  However, this is probably due to the fact that there are a lot more men than women in the dataset.  

Therefore, in the second bar graph, we look at the proportion of individuals within each gender that listed each job field.  In other words, a bit more than 12.5% of the men in the data set listed "computer/hardware/software" as their job, while about 3% of the women in the data set listed that same job.  From the second plot, we see that there are certain fields with a greater percentage of females than males relative to the total number of females and males.

Smoking by Gender:

An exploration of the missing values reveal that about the same proportion of individuals from each gender declined to answer their smoking status, which indicates that an EDA of smoking by gender without those values may not be too skewed.

The first plot, which denotes the frequency of individuals of each gender in each smoking status, tells us that there is a greater number of male individuals in each smoking category.  However, the second plot, which denotes the proportion of individuals in each gender group in each smoking status, tells us that more women than men proportionally never smoke.

## Question 2:

In the file `HW-2_Shiny_App.Rmd`, build the Shiny App discussed in Lec09 on
Monday 10/3: Using the `movies` data set in the `ggplot2movies` data set, make a
Shiny app that

* Plots budget on the x-axis and rating on the y-axis
* Instead of having a radio button to select the genre of movie (`Action`,
`Animation`, `Comedy`, etc), have a radio button that allows you to toggle
between comedies and non-comedies. This app should be simpler.
